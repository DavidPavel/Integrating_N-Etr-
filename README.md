This program calculates the area under the transverse electron distribution curve, data took with TESS for Caesium on a Copper photocathode 

During analysing the photocathodes from CERN, we did an experiment with a copper photocathode, 
depositing caesium on top for three different stages in order to look for photoemission at visible wavelengths
